#----------------------- Intro for python GUI -------------------------

"""The ui is a mode of communication of an application/program
with user."""

"""GUI - Graphical User Interface - One of form which allow user to 
interact with computers through visual indicators using items such as 
icon,menu and window etc."""

#------ Older Ui  Forms--------

""" 
    CLI - Command Line Interface
    MUI - Menu User Interface - Character Oriented terminal - 
    Menu item selection - Consist with selecting menu items 
    with numbers or arrows 
"""

#----- Benefits of GUI ---------

""" 
    Easier for learning and using
    Allows multi-tasking
    Visually pleasing
    Easier for communication (i.e.: Presentation of information)
    Better Accessibility
"""

#----- Drawback of GUI ---------

"""
    Resource intensive
    Less control of the program
    Slower than non-GUI
"""

#----- What is Tkinter ? ---------

"""
    In-build python module for create GUI Application
    Comes with python installation
    It Gives Object Orient interface to Tk GUI toolkit.

1. Object and Class:

Object: An object is an instance of a class in object-oriented programming (OOP). It represents a real-world entity and 
has attributes (characteristics) and behaviors (actions).

Class: A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the 
objects created from the class will have.

2. Why Object Orientation?

Modularity: Objects encapsulate data and methods, promoting modularity and code organization.
Reusability: Classes and objects facilitate code reuse, reducing redundancy in code.
Abstraction: OOP allows developers to abstract complex systems into manageable entities, focusing on high-level design.
Encapsulation: Encapsulation restricts direct access to some of an object's components, protecting the integrity of the 
data.

3. Abstract data types

Abstract Data type (ADT) is a type (or class) for objects whose behavior is defined by a set of values and a set of 
operations.
