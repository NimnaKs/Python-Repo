Programming Fundamentals With Python

### Variables

Variable is a name given to memory location .
It is a basic storage unit of the program.

Basic Attributes of Variables

| Name or Identifier | Scope    | Type    | Lifetime | Value    | Address   |
| ------------------ | -------- | ------- | -------- | -------- | --------- |
| Example1          | Global   | Integer | Long     | 42       | 0x7fff... |
| Example2          | Local    | String  | Short    | "Hello"  | 0x7fff... |

Name or Attribute: The name or attribute of the variable/entity.

Scope: The scope of the variable (e.g., Global, Local).

Type: The data type of the variable.

Lifetime: The lifetime or duration the variable exists (e.g., Short, Long).

Value: The current value of the variable.

Address: The memory address of the variable.

### Identifier

Identifier name should start with letter or underscore. (Ex : _num,num)

Identifier name should not start with number.

Identifier should contain only with alphanumeric and underscore.

Name is case-sensitive.(num and Num is different )

### DataTypes 

The data type for a variable is the type of data it holds. It defines the values you
can assign to it, and the operation you can apply on the variable.

In python data type of variable is dynamically change.

#### Core Data Type

Number - int , float , complex
Sequence - List , Tuple , range
Map - Dict
Set - set , frozenset
Text - Str
Boolean - bool
None - NoneType
Binary type - Byte,ByteArray,MemoryView

### Standard Data Types 

There are 5 standard data types.

Numeric - Integer , Complex , Float
Boolean 
Set - Frozen Set , Set - Collection of unordered items where each item unique in set.
A set is mutable in nature.
Dictionary - Collection of unordered data items where each consist of key value pairs.
Sequence - String , Range , List , Tuple - Ordered collection of similar or different types of data.
The data inside the sequence standard or user defined type.

String - A string is a sequence of UNICODE characters.
List - Sequence of values seperated by comma.
Tuple - Similar to List, but it is immutable in nature.
