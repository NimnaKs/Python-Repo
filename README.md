Basic Attributes of Variables

| Name or Identifier | Scope    | Type    | Lifetime | Value    | Address   |
| ------------------ | -------- | ------- | -------- | -------- | --------- |
| Example1          | Global   | Integer | Long     | 42       | 0x7fff... |

### DataTypes 

The data type for a variable is the type of data it holds. It defines the values you
can assign to it, and the operation you can apply on the variable.

In python data type of variable is dynamically change.

#### Core Data Type

Number - int , float , complex
Sequence - List , Tuple , range
Map - Dict
Set - set , frozenset
Text - Str
Boolean - bool
None - NoneType
Binary type - Byte,ByteArray,MemoryView
