Programming Fundamentals With Python

### Variables

Variable is a name given to memory location .
It is a basic storage unit of the program.

Basic Attributes of Variables

| Name or Identifier | Scope    | Type    | Lifetime | Value    | Address   |
| ------------------ | -------- | ------- | -------- | -------- | --------- |
| Example1          | Global   | Integer | Long     | 42       | 0x7fff... |
| Example2          | Local    | String  | Short    | "Hello"  | 0x7fff... |

Name or Attribute: The name or attribute of the variable/entity.

Scope: The scope of the variable (e.g., Global, Local).

Type: The data type of the variable.

Lifetime: The lifetime or duration the variable exists (e.g., Short, Long).

Value: The current value of the variable.

Address: The memory address of the variable.

### Identifier

Identifier name should start with letter or underscore. (Ex : _num,num)

Identifier name should not start with number.

Identifier should contain only with alphanumeric and underscore.

Name is case-sensitive.(num and Num is different )

### DataTypes 

The data type for a variable is the type of data it holds. It defines the values you
can assign to it, and the operation you can apply on the variable.

In python data type of variable is dynamically change.

#### Core Data Type

Number - int , float , complex
Sequence - List , Tuple , range
Map - Dict
Set - set , frozenset
Text - Str
Boolean - bool
None - NoneType
Binary type - Byte,ByteArray,MemoryView

### Standard Data Types 

There are 5 standard data types.

1 . Numeric - Integer , Complex , Float

2 . Mapping Type - Dictionary: Represents a collection of key-value pairs enclosed
in curly braces ({}) with unique keys.

3 . Set Type - Set: Represents an unordered and mutable collection of unique
elements, enclosed in curly braces ({}) or using the set() function.

4 . Boolean Data Type(bool): Represents either True or False, used for logical
operations and conditions.

5 . None: The NoneType object is a special type in Python that represents the
absence of a value.We can assign None to any variable, but you can not create
other NoneType objects. Note: All variables that are assigned None point to the
same object.

6 . Sequence Type  - String , List , Tuple , Range
A sequence is an ordered collection of similar or different types of
data.

String Data Type(str): Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in single
quotes (‘ ‘) or double quotes (” “), such as “Hello, World!”, ‘Python’.

List: Represents an ordered and mutable collection of items, enclosed in square
brackets ([]).

Tuple: Represents an ordered and immutable collection of items, enclosed in
parentheses ().

Range: A sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1
(by default), and stops before a specified number
